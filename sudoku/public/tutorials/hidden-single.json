      "title": "What is a Hidden Single?",
      "content": "A Hidden Single occurs when a particular digit can only be placed in one cell within a row, column, or box. Even though that cell may have multiple candidates, the digit is 'hidden' among them — but it's the only place it can go in that house."

    {
      "title": "Naked vs. Hidden",
      "content": "With a Naked Single, the cell itself has only one candidate. With a Hidden Single, you focus on a specific digit and find that it can only go in one cell within a house (row, column, or box)."

      "title": "Place the digit",
      "content": "Since 5 can only go in one cell within this box, it must go there — even if the cell has other candidates too. That's what makes it 'hidden': the cell might look like it has multiple options, but for this specific digit, there's no other choice.",

      "title": "Strategy for finding Hidden Singles",
      "content": "A good approach is to pick a digit (say 1) and scan all 9 boxes, then all 9 rows, then all 9 columns. For each house, ask: 'Where can this digit go?' If the answer is only one cell, you've found a Hidden Single."
